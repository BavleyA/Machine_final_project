# Flight Ticket Price Prediction using SGD Model

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict flight ticket prices based on various features such as departure and arrival times, airlines, origin and destination cities, and other relevant factors. The model used for the prediction is the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm.

## Project Overview

Flight ticket prices can vary significantly depending on numerous factors, such as time of booking, flight duration, airline, and more. In this project, we aim to predict flight ticket prices using an SGD model, which is an optimization method for linear regression. The dataset used for training and testing contains historical flight data, including both structured and categorical features.
